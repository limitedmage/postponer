Postponer is a pair of Chrome extensions to add to and manage your Read It Later reading list.

Postponer integrates RIL's great bookmarklets (available at http://readitlaterlist.com/bookmarklets) with Chrome's interface for a simple way to manage your reading list.

Postponer Adder (https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pggmlienkcoenodbjpkbidlmmedgonai) adds an icon in the Chrome address bar for quickly adding items to your reading list. It can also show the number of unread icons in your list on an icon badge (go to the Options page to enable this).

Postponer Manager (https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mmfblgljgoaokhbcjnddgcnaielcpjeb) adds an icon in the Chrome toolbar to open your reading list with all your unread items. From there, you can open items, mark as read, etc.

The extensions were designed to be used together, but can also be used on their own. The reason why there are two extensions is because Chrome does not allow one extension to add icons to both the address bar and the toolbar.
